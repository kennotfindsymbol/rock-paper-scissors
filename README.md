# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction

This is a rock paper scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This is my project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

It is a 5-round game. If you win a round you get 3 points. If you tie with the computer you get 1 point. If you lose no point.

## How to play

- Press F12 to open the console.
- type game() in the console.
- Type your choice between 'Rock' or 'Paper' or 'Scissors' (case does not matter).
- See if you win, tie or lose this round.
- After 5 rounds, you will see your total score.
